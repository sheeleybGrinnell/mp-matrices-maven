Adjusted the .equals function for MatrixV0 to make use of the hash method to find equality.
Note: MatrixExperimentsTest.java does not work, Professor Sam Rebelsky said it is ok that the test fails. It is due to some windows error.
Fixed many many checkstyle errors, mostly found in MatrixV0.java and AssociativeArray.java
